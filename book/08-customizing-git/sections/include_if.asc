===== `[includeIf]`

Many Git users have multiple local "workspaces"—i.e. multiple sets of multiple cloned repositories—for the purpose of separating, say, work or school projects from personal ones.

These workspaces may organized like:

* `~/Repositories/work/cloned-repository-name`
* `~/Repositories/personal/other-cloned-repository-name`

Each set may be defined by a common factor such as the following:

* `"hasconfig:remote.*.url:https://git.cs.example.edu/**"`
* `"gitdir:example_corp/"`

There are multiple ways of approaching the issue, and several examples follow.

As each of these sets may have a different signing identity, it may become tedious setting it up for every single cloned repository.

Other repetitive setup tasks may apply for a given user, but signing identities are the first that comes to mind.
